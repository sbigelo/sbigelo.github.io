For my second portfolio project I deciced the keep with the theme of my previous one. My last one was a CLI application that allowed you to see a lsit of Rocky Mountain National Park hiking trails. It had information about each one that you were able to see if you selected it. 

I originally had an alternative idea that caused some problems. After I build my application with the original idea, I realized it would be a massive pain to change everything over. Instead of using "trails" as the links, I had built it with "projects". I attempted to find and replace all of the matching words in my text editor, but was unsuccessful. I didnt want to completely restart, so I kept the "projects" in and made sure that what the user saw was "trails". 

As a self-paced student, I ran into some obstacles. When we were asked to start from scratch, I followed along with a video that was provided and previous labs. This worked to a degree. My main obstacle was that the instructions on how to switch to a local environment. The instructions were useful with downloading the needed materials, but absolutely zero help with how to interact or use the text editor. It would be useful if they added a link or two as how to use it. I had to use ask a question, but even then, the initial person that contacted me was not helpful. The coach that helped me was very insightful and helpful. I now know how to utilize the text editor because I went and watched videos on it. Overall, I wish there was a section that you could ask questions that are miscellaneous for problems like this because it's not the first time.

I am happy to say that I learned a lot from completing this project. I learned, through the magic of sinatra, that the index and layout are intertwined. The "<%=yield%>" in layout.erb is a base for building around each webpage to make it seamlessly flow. I also utilized modules to avoid DRY. I included the "find_by_slug" and "slug" in the module. This was, I was not repeating the same code over and over in multiple locations. I extended and included them into the project and user files so that the scope could be wider and used in many locations. 

The gem sinatra/flash was a tricky one. It is apart of the bonus to include warning signs that pop up when say the fields to sign up were not filled out. I attempted it as best I could by following the instructions and outside research. I could not get it to work, but at least put the code in. The code for the warning messages is put in as notes that does not affect the application. I hope when I am doing my review that I can get some pointers from the person I am paired with. 

Finally, it was satifsying completing this project. I am fianlly able to see how all of the pieces of the puzzle are coming togehter. I now am getting an understating of what it takes to become a full stack developer.
