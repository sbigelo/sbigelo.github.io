For my first project at Flatiron, I decided to write the CLI application about hiking trails. I gained a huge likeness towards hiking when I was previously living in Colorado. There are so many different places to chose from and what better way to get to know them than this project. 


It was interesting and fun to be able to put my skills to the test. I was able to use this real world example to practice what I have learned. This also forced me to getting better at using Object Orientation Programing. It definitely helped to have a few examples and tutorials to go off of. Starting from scratch can be intimidating, but the tools given put my mind at ease.

My main struggle with this project was with scraping data. I now have a way better grip on scrapping data with Nokogiri using CSS. I learned that there are other tools like XPath that can help in ways that CSS selectors alone cant. This led me to do some research into XPath. I found that it can be useful for finding multiple class selectors. I ran into the problem of having the titles not all be in the same location/class. I am still attempting to figure this out with just using CSS, but am finding very little information to get past this problem. 

Once I got the scraping down, the rest seemed to be a breeze. It was a matter of plugging in the values that I assigned each detail of the specific trail. Each trail had a name, location, feature, miles, elevation gain, difficulty, and a link. I assigned the scraped data to each as best as I could. There is still a gap in one section, but the project says that it is not focused on your ability to scrape. It is instead focused on being able to, "demonstrate your ability to write concise, easy-to-read Object-Oriented Ruby code". 

Overall, this has been a great learning experience. I am happy that I was forced to problem solve in order to complete this. I cant wait for the next one!
